- **Key Skills**: Unity, C#, game design
- **Platform**: HTML5 (https://gahfa.itch.io/minesetter), PC
- **Description**: This is a simple game prototype designed for the 48 hour GMTK game jam themed on "Roles Reversed" 
- **Reflection**: This is actually the first game jam I joined. There were plenty of things I could have done and improved (e.g. adding tutorials or different difficulty levels) as lacking experience for individually design and development from scratch in a short time, but I did have great fun figuring out how to fit the theme and making it interesting. Receiving both good and bad feedback is beneficial.

## Game rules
This project keeps the same rule pattern as the classic MineSweeper game, but this time to set all the mines! 
Click on the 16*16 board to place a mine until all 40 mines are set up successfully. Restart by clicking the pop-up button after clearing a game.


## Credits
The project follows part of the design of MineSweeper.
