## Game rules

This project keeps the basic rules of the classic snake game and extends with the theme of travelling around the world - The player controls a train to pick up tourists (pegman) and collect special cuisines while avoiding smashing the train into the landmarks or itself or cross boundary.

#### Some exciting features:
- Delicate "travalling" **theme-based designs**
- **3 theme alternatives** of destination (Cairo, London and Tokyo), with different maps, bonus (cuisines) and obstacles (landmarks) for each.
- Varied difficulty levels, changing the speed of snake and number of obstacles.
- Permanent high score ranking board allows you to compete your score with other players!
- **Battle game mode** allowing 2 players to compete locally with <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> <kbd>WASD</kbd>.
